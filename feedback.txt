OVERALL: Satisfactory

The comments below are all mostly minor comments. You have done a suitable amount of work to gather, analyze, and present data, and your methodology and results are reasonable.

* "run traceroute on each of our original domains to examine intermediate nodes and end servers (supporting domains)" – in this context, the "end servers" are "original domains" (not "supporting domains")
* Using the term "supporting domains" to refer to "intermediate nodes" in "traceroute on each of our original domains" and "network activity when directly visiting the original domains" is confusing – it would be clearer to use the terminology "intermediate domains" for the former and "supporting domains" for the latter
* "determine the geographic location of these intermediate nodes and end servers via IP address lookups" – this required more than just knowing the IP addresses of the intermediate nodes and end servers; you also needed a mapping from IPs to geo location
* "getCDN.py: This script interates through each traceroute output file and extracts the domain name from the filename, retrieves the associated AS names for each IP found and writes detailed AS information to an output file. If the AS is identified as part of a CDN, it writes this information to a separate CDN-specific output file." – it sounds like you are not differentiating between intermediate nodes and end servers when analyzing CDN usage; differentiating between the two would be better
* "GetDevToolCDNs.py:his script reads through the DevToolTraceroute2k folder containing additional domains, extracts IP addresses and Autonomous System (AS) names for each domain queried, and stores them in a file named DevToolASes.csv. It then checks if each AS name in DevToolASes.csv is in our CDN dataset. If found, it writes the domain, IP address, and CDN name to DevToolCDNs.csv. This provides a list of additional domains from the DevTool that utilize CDNs to load their information." – it is odd that (assuming my above comment is correct) you consider intermediate nodes when considering CDN usage for original domains, but do not consider CDN usage for intermediate nodes when considering supporting domains identified by devtool
* "getIPS.py: This script iterates through each traceroute output file and extracts all the domain names and their corresponding IP addresses from each. If both an IP address and a domain name are found in the line, they are added to the dictionary with the domain name as the key and the IP address as the value." – it sounds like some of the work being done by this script overlaps with the work that must also be done by traceASPaths.py
* The "Intermediate Servers" section of the poster talks about both "intermediate servers" and "intermediate routers" – I'm not sure what an "intermediate server" means; are "intermediate servers" and "intermediate routers" actually the same thing? Also, is the pie chart only showing intermediaries that are within the US? Finally, I would expect to see some intermediaries in other US states if some of the traffic is going to California
* "NYC had the highest number of end servers compared to other U.S. cities like San Francisco (relative to our data). NYC’s large population makes the destination an ideal server location." – Your findings are probably not due to population, and are instead due to the fact that your source (a server at Colgate) is closer to NYC than to California.
